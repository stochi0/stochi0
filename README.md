My interests lie chiefly in the study of post-training methods, agentic systems, and reinforcement learning.

Of late, my efforts have been directed toward:

- training at considerable computational scale  
- the development of agents and reinforcement-driven optimisation  
- problems requiring persistence across long horizons
